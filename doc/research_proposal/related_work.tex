\section{Related work}

This work is not the first attempt at accelerating a LES model using GPU's. In fact, DALES itself has been ported to GPU's before by \citet{Schalkwijk2012}. To this end, the original Fortran code of DALES was translated to C++ and calculations were moved to the GPU using NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA).
