\section{Related work}

This work is not the first attempt at accelerating a LES model using GPU's. In fact, DALES itself has been ported to GPU's before by \citet{schalkwijkHighPerformanceSimulationsTurbulent2012}. To this end, the original Fortran code of DALES was translated to C++ and calculations were moved to the GPU using NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), resulting in the GPU-resident Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (GALES) model. \citet{schalkwijkHighPerformanceSimulationsTurbulent2012} found that GALES was able to reduce the wall clock time per time step by a factor of 2 compared to DALES, though it should be noted that GALES uses single precision floating point numbers in most parts of the simulation, while DALES uses double precision. GPU's especially well tuned for single precision calculations. 

\citet{costaFFTbasedFinitedifferenceSolver2018} has developed a tool for DNS of turbulent flows, called CaNS (short for Canonical Navier-Stokes solver), which was later ported to GPU's using CUDA Fortran
