\section{Background}

Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a numerical tool for simulating turbulent flows. As opposed to the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, which does not resolve any turbulence, and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), which resolves all turbulent scales, LES only resolves the largest turbulent scales which carry the most energy, while the small scales are parameterized.
