\section{Background}
The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is a highly turbulent flow consisting of a wide range of turbulent eddies (whirling motions). Solving the Navier-Stokes equations explicitly for all scales is called direct numerical simulation (DNS). However, because the scales of these eddies ranges from millimeters to tens of kilometers, DNS is computationally very expensive, making simulations of the ABL with a reasonable domain size unfeasable \citep{moengNUMERICALMODELSLargeEddy2015}. Instead of resolving all scales, one could settle on resolving only the largest, most energetic scales explicitly and model the smaller scales. Such a simulation is called large-eddy simulation (LES). The Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) model developed by \citet{heusFormulationDutchAtmospheric2010}, 

OpenACC provides a range of \emph{compiler directives}, which can be used to offload loops to the GPU. An example of such a loop, decorated with an OpenACC directive, can be found in \autoref{listing:accloop}. This directive-based approach offers multiple benefits over the traditional, lower-level programming models such as CUDA and OpenCL \citep{herdmanAcceleratingHydrocodesOpenACC2012}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Productivity: OpenACC requires minimal addition of lines of code to an existing codebase. This makes it possible for a programmer to accelerate large sections of a program in a relatively short amount of time. 
    \item Single source code: CUDA and OpenCL require the programmer to rewrite existing code into ``\emph{compute kernels}'' that are executed on the GPU. If it is desired that a program is still able to run on CPU's, two versions of the same program have to be maintained: one version for CPU's and one version for GPU's. Needless to say, this is more error-prone than a single source code. As OpenACC directives are essentially just comments in the code, the programmer can add them to the existing CPU code. The same code can then be compiled for execution on both GPU's and CPU's, and the OpenACC directives will simply be ignored for the latter.
\end{itemize}

% As opposed to the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, which does not resolve any turbulence, and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), which resolves all turbulent scales, LES only resolves the largest turbulent scales which carry the most energy, while the small scales are parameterized \citep{masonLargeEddySimulationConvective1989}.
