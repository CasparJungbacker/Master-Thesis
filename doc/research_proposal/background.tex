\section{Background}
Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a technique for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in turbulent flows. In a LES simulation, the largest turbulent eddies, which carry the most kinetic energy, are resolved explicitly, while the smaller eddies are modelled. 



% As opposed to the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, which does not resolve any turbulence, and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), which resolves all turbulent scales, LES only resolves the largest turbulent scales which carry the most energy, while the small scales are parameterized \citep{masonLargeEddySimulationConvective1989}.
